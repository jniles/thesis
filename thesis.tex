\chapter{Fragility in the Code}

The first investigations into nuclear architecture were conducted by
examining cell karyotypes.  Despite the development of the karyotype as a
tool for examining nuclear material in the early 20th
century\cite{levitsky1924}, it wasn't until 1954 the number of chromosomes in
a human cell were definitely described\cite{tjio1956}.  Early investigations
into nuclear architecture, even at the course level of a karyotype, were
hampered by technical limitations and chromosomal phenomena such as
non-dysjunction and breakage.  It is not surprising that soon after the
initial description the human chromosomal number, Debakan and colleagues
characterized common sites were chromosomes would undergo breakage or
translocations.  They termed these regions
\textit{chromosomal fragile sites}\cite{leyden2008}.

Many particularities render studying fragile sites difficult.  The
first difficulty is semantic; chromosomal fragile sites are not precisely
defined in the literature.  When a study is performed that encompasses fragile
sites, typically one of three definitions is used: regions that are particularly
sensitive to forming gaps or breaks on metaphase chromosomes\cite{glover2005},
sites where chromatin fails to compact under mitosis\cite{leyden2008}, and
non-randomly distributed loci that exhibit an increased frequency of breakage
under replicational stress\cite{franchitto2013}.  For the purposes of this
discussion, a \textit{fragile site} is a region on the chromosome prone to
forming complex rearrangements, particularly double-strand breaks, repeat
extensions, and translocations, when subjected to replicational stress.  These
rearrangements play a pivotal role in many severely deliberating genetic
diseases.

Fragile sites come in two flavors: common fragile sites (CFS) and rare fragile
sites (RFS).  Fragile sites are classified into a group based on their
prevalence in the population, and the conditions under which their fragility
is induced\cite{leyden2008}.  Common fragile sites are thought to be common
most chromosomes and to all humans, while rare fragile sites may be expressed
in small fraction (less than 5\%) of the population\cite{wells2006}.

These
rearrangements play pivotal roles in severely debilitating genetic diseases
such as Fragile X Syndrome.  All males and an estimated that 60\% of females
with repeat anomalies near the FRM1 gene on the X chromosome suffer
from severe mental handicap due to these alterations\cite{sutherland1995}.
Additionally, fragile sites are often found rearranged in human
cancers\cite{glover2005}.  Despite these findings, reason fragile site are
fragile is still an unanswered question.
