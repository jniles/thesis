\section*{Normalization and Interaction Scaling}
Notably, the scaling ratios are unchanged by normalization, indicating that scaling may be a property of the underlying distribution
rather than an artifact of out data processing.  Indeed, this indicates that perhaps normalization should be performed, as is
done in HiCNorm \citep{hu2012} on a chromosome by chromosome basis, estimating different background distributions for each chromosome
rather than using a generalized fitting algorithm such as IPF\@.
