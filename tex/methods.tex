\section{Data Collection}

The cell lines used in this thesis are the IMR90 lung fibroblast cell line and the H1 human embryonic stem
cell line.  Unless otherwise stated, the data obtained for these cell lines are wild type, reference sequences
and mappings.

\subsection{Processing Chromatin Interaction Data}

The Hi-C data sets used in this thesis were obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO)\cite{edgar2002}
as Sequence Read Archive (SRA) files\footnote{Accession Number %
\href{http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE43070}{GSE43070}.}.  A bash script was written
to download six experimental replicates of IMR90 cells and two replicates of H1 hESCs from GEO onto a
local machine for analysis.  Using the Hi-C library prepared by Imakaev and colleagues\cite{imakaev2012},
the chimeric reads were realigned to the human genome (UCSC build hg19) using the Bowtie2 alignment
algorithm\cite{langmead2012} with default parameters.  The interactions matrices were prepared and processed
using custom scripts written in the Python programming language.

\subsection{Gene Expression and Pathway Analysis}

Affymetrix gene expression microarray data for IMR90 and H1 hESCs were obtained from GEO (GSE2672\cite{kim2005}
and GSE54186\cite{kim2014}, respectively).  Probe annotations were downloaded from the Affymetrix site for
the Human Genome U133v2 array, and remapped to genes from UCSC\@.  Noticing that expression profiles for replicates
were similar, the gene expression levels for each cell line were calculated by averaging across replicates, and
taking the log2 transform of the averaged signal, yielding signal for $23,100$ genes.

% TODO Kolmogorov-Smirnov test w/ normal distribution

To understand expression changes during differentiation from stem cell to lung cell, I subtracted the lung expression
signal from the stem cell line.  Taking the log2 transform yields the fold change in gene expression level per gene.
Two groups of genes were selected for further analysis: the 100 most upregulated genes and the 100 most downregulated
genes.  I was curious to find out whether classes of genes were changing together.  Using the ConsensusPathDB
tool\cite{kamburov2012}, I performed over-representation analysis for pathways and gene ontologies.

\subsection{Chromatin Accessibility Assay}

Additionally, analyzed tracks for DNA methylation at base pair
resolution were obtained from GEO\cite{lister2009}.  The liftOver tool from
the University of California Santa Cruise was used to update the methylation
data from human genome build hg18 to hg19 for meaningful comparison\cite{hinrichs2006}.
For detailed data collection notes, see Appendix I.

The detailed description of the treatment protocol used in creating the Hi-C
library can be found in the original paper\cite{ren2013}.  Briefly, the IMR90
cells were cultured in growth media.

The cell lines were prepared with no treatment according to the protocol
described by Dekker and colleagues\cite{dekker2013}.  In brief, the cells
are washed with a formaldehyde fixation solution to cross-links DNA and
protein molecules near each other in genomic space.  The cells are
lysed and the nuclear contents are treated with a non-specific restriction
enzyme, \textit{HindIII}.  After restriction, the remaining nuclear material
is washed so that the remaining contents are short DNA sequences or cross
-linked DNA-protein complexes.  The DNA reads are labeled with a biotin
marker and ligated at low concentrations that favor within ligation between
reads bound to the same complex.  The reads are captured and sequenced,
building what is known as a Hi-C library.

\section{Mapping and Alignment}

A Hi-C library is formed largely of \textit{chimeric} DNA sequences,
sequences composed of material from more than one source.  The ligation process
creates novel DNA sequences with a portion of sequence from one region of
the genome and the remaining portion from a different genomic region.  In
order to discover to which two regions each probe corresponds, the probes
must be realigned to the human genome.  Previous methods (\textit{citation needed})
have truncated reads to a fixed cutoff size before realignment with a short
read alignment algorithm.  In a recent paper, Imakaev and colleagues
describe an algorithm to repeated align reads with different truncation sizes
and analyzing reads with the maximum alignment score\cite{imakaev2012}.  We followed
this procedure to realign the IMR90 Hi-C libraries for six replicates to
the human genome build 19 (CRCh38/hg19), with an average of XX million reads
mapped per replicate.

\section{Normalization of Contact Maps}

Understanding and accounting the biases inherent in a data set is vital to
producing accurate, biologically relevant analysis.  To this end, several methods
have been proposed identify biases and normalize contact maps between replicates
and experiments\cite{yaffe2011}\cite{hu2012}\cite{yang2014}.  The earliest methods on low
resolution samples did not perform any normalization at all\cite{aiden2009};
however, as higher resolution data sets have come available, better
normalization methods are being explored to identify reproducible,
fine-grained chromatin structures.

Normalizing data from Hi-C experiments is quite challenging.  As previously
discussed, the Hi-C data sets are heterogeneous in nature, incorporating
interactions from cells in every position of cell cycle.  As evidence of phenomena,
the interaction matrices produced by the Hi-C experiments have nonzero contact
probabilities between nearly every genomic coordinate\cite{dekker2013}.  This
finding is further reinforced by the observation that single cell Hi-C analysis
shows high variability in chromatin architecture\cite{nagano2013}.  Despite this
variability, existing normalization techniques for Hi-C data sets typically
assume the majority of the cells in the sampled ensemble are in a static
chromatin conformation reflective of \textit{in vivo} cell populations.

One approach to normalization described by Yaffe and colleagues\cite{yaffe2011}
attempts to describe the total interaction frequency between loci as the product
of a true interaction frequency and a set of experimental biases.  These biases
are present in all chromosomal capture techniques.  They include biases due to
PCR in efficiency, read depth per region, sequencing bias, chromatin compaction,
and random background collisions during ligation\cite{benner2014}\cite{dekker2006}.
