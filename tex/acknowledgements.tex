For my grandparents
\end{dedication}

\begin{acknowledgements}
I would like to thank each of my committee members for their patience, support, and work ethic.  I am grateful to Dr.\ Tyrone Ryba, who
took me on as a stranger and worked with me through all my misgivings.  Dr.\ Patrick McDonald's advice and encouragement (though sometimes
unheeded) shaped me into a better individual.  Finally, Dr.\ Necmettin Yildirim made my foray into computation possible through classes,
tutorials, and unmatched enthusiasm.  It has been my great honor to work with and learn from each of these great men.

I'd like to thank several other professors who played a formative role in my tuition.  Dr.\ Christopher Hart first interested me in
bioinformatics and taught me programming practices that were invaluable this year.  Dr.\ Amy Clore taught me not only biology, but how
to be a good biologist.

Last but not least, my parents taught me the value of wisdom and work ethic.  If I ever amount to anything, it is a direct product of
their love and support.  Thank you.
