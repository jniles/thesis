For my grandparents

This analysis would not have been possible without the patience, support, and encouragement of my committee members.  I am grateful to
Dr.\ Tyrone Ryba, who took me on as a stranger and worked with me through all my blunders.  Dr.\ Patrick McDonald's advice and
encouragement (though sometimes unheeded) shaped me into a better individual.  Finally, Dr.\ Necmettin Yildirim made my foray into
computation possible through classes, tutorials, and unmatched enthusiasm.  It has been a great honor working with and learning from
each of these great men.

I'd like to thank several other professors who played a formative role in my tuition.  Dr.\ Christopher Hart first interested me in
bioinformatics and taught me programming practices that were invaluable this year.  Dr.\ Amy Clore taught me not only biology, but how
to be a good biologist.

Last but not least, my parents taught me the value of wisdom and work ethic.  If I ever amount to anything, it is a direct product of
their love and support.  Thank you.
