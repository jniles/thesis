I am honored that some incredible professors have supported me with patience and encouragement throughout my thesis endeavours. This
analysis would be possible without the inspiration and correction from each of my committee members.  I am grateful to
Dr.\ Ryba, who took on a stranger and worked with me through all my clumsiness.  Dr.\ McDonald offered me advice,
reassurance, and struggles to teach me discipline.  Dr.\ Yildirim is kind, understanding, and ultimately made possible my foray
into computational analysis leading by example and lecture.  I am grateful for their guidance on my committee.

Several other professors played a formative role in my tuition.  Dr.\ Clore tirelessly helped me navigate the biology curriculum, despite
my compulsive wanderings into statistics, mathematics, and computer science.  Most importantly, Dr.\ Clore taught me what it means to be
a good biologist.  Dr.\ Hart opened the world of bioinformatics and scientific publishing to my eyes, and threw in a number of Regexp tricks
to boot.  Last but certainly not least, Dr.\ Poimenidou taught me both calculus and linear algebra.  It is a testament to her teaching
skills that we got this far.
