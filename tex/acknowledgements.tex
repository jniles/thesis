\begin{dedication}
For my grandparents, whose compassion changed the world
\end{dedication}

\begin{acknowledgements}
I would like to thank each of my committee members for their patience, support, and work ethic.  I am grateful to Dr.\ Tyrone Ryba, who
took me on as a stranger and worked with me through all my misgivings.  Dr.\ Patrick McDonald's advice and encouragement (though sometimes
unheeded) shaped me into a better individual.  Finally, Dr.\ Necmettin Yildirim made my foray into computation possible through classes,
tutorials, and unmatched enthusiasm.  It has been my great honor to work closely with these gentlemen.

My parents taught me the value of learning and work ethic.  If I ever amount to anything, it is a direct product of their love.  Thank you.
